# dotnet-http-svc
This project sets up a .NET-based HTTP service that listens on a specified port through an EC2 instance's IP. The deployment is fully automated, ensuring the service is configured and running as soon as the EC2 instance is created. The automation is handled using user data scripts, allowing seamless deployment without manual intervention.
